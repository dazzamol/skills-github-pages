# Recreating Gapminder in Tableau: A Humble tribute to Hans Rosling

Hans Rosling in his famous [video](https://www.gapminder.org/videos/the-joy-of-stats/) showed told us the story of the world’s 200 countries over 200 years using 120,000 numbers — in just four minutes. Plotting life expectancy against income for every country since 1810, Hans showed how the world we live in is radically different from the world most of us imagine to be.

_I will try to recreate the same visualization (as shown in the video/talk) to analyse how Life Expectancy in years (health) and GDP per capita (wealth) have changed over time in the world for various countries.This will a small tribute to the master storyteller who passed away on 7 February 2017._
