# Data Visualisation with Tableau

Our goal as Data Analysts is to arrange the insights of our data in such a way that everybody who sees them is able to understand their implications and how to act on them clearly.

Tableau is a data analytics and visualization tool used widely in the industry today. Many businesses even consider it indispensable for data-science-related work. Tableau's ease of use comes from the fact that it has a drag and drop interface. This feature helps to perform tasks like sorting, comparing and analyzing, very easily and fast. Tableau is also compatible with multiple sources, including Excel, SQL Server, and cloud-based data repositories which makes it an excellent choice for Data Scientists.
