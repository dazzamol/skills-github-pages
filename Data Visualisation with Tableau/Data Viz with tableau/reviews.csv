S.No,Reviews1,I feel so LUCKY to have found this used (phone to us & not used hard at all)2,nice phone3,Very pleased4,It works good but it goes slow sometimes but its a very good phone I love it5,Great phone to replace my lost phone. The only thing is the volume up button does not work6,I already had a phone with problems... I know it stated it was used7,The charging port was loose. I got that soldered in. Then needed a new battery as well. $100 later (not including cost of purchase) I have a usable phone. The phone should not have been sold in the state it was in.8,Phone looks good but wouldn't stay charged9,I originally was using the Samsung S2 Galaxy for Sprint and wanted to return back to the Samsung EPIC 4G for Sprint because I really missed the keyboard10,This is a great product it came after two days of ordering it. There was only one little blemish on the side11,These guys are the best! I had a little situation with my item but they quickly fixed the issue. I was pleased and will definitely be buying another phon from them if I need one.12,I'm really disappointed about my phone and service. The phone went out on me over a week ago. Instead of handling it when issue first surfaced. I've been told to do this and do that. Now I'm stick with no phone and I'm out 55 dollars for service that I'm not using. I still haven't received a mailing label to return item. This was my first purchase on amazon. I'm not rushing to use theirs or smartphones 288 business Anytime soon. I thought I was getting a deal but it seems like I'm the one who lucked out.13,Ordered this phone as a replacement for the same model until my contract expires and I can get a new one. Seller confirmation said delivery could take up to 7 days. Seller sent out the phone within hours of receiving the order and I had the phone the next day. Phone looks better than described was able to transfer data from the old one to the new one with no problems. Highly recommend this seller14,Had this phone before and loved it but was not working so I got this phone. One thing is the SD card slot does not open up when I try to access it in file managment15,I was able to get the phone I previously owned...with a keyboard and touch screen. It's the best phone and I love it. I still had to clean the device with my service provider16,I brought this phone as a replacement for my daughter17,I love the phone. It does everything I need and works great. I purchased four of these phones through a seller that shipped from Amazon's warehouse. My only problem is that the phone didn't come with a micro sd card. I couldn't use the camera until I got the card. No problems getting these activated at Sprint.18,The battery was old & had been over used because it barely holds a charge. Otherwise19,pros-beautiful screen20,I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.21,Phone good just a little slow phone old but it's a great phone temporary right now. thank you for the great deal22,Phone's speaker little low.
